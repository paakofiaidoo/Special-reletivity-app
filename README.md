# Special-relativity-calculator
This application is a calculator for all the effect and application of special relativity 
this involves:
1. time dilation
2. length contraction
3. Galilean Transformations
4. Lorentz Transformations
5. Relativistic Doppler effect
6. Relativistic Momentum
7. Relativistic Kinetic Energy
8. Relativistic Energy
9. Lorentz factor (gamma)
10. speed ratio (beta)

for this calculations we will use:

-the speed of light ,c which can be c= 3e8 m/s or c= 299792458 m/s



recommended ide is code:blocks
download code::blocks from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/32bit/codeblocks-20.03mingw-32bit-setup.exe

how to open project when using code::blocks
-git clone "https://github.com/paakofiaidoo/Special-reletivity-app.git"
-cd "Special Relativity app"
-cd "Special Relativity Calculator"
