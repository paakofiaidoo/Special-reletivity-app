# Special-reletivity-app
This application is a calculator for all the effect and applcation of special reletivity 
this involes:
1. time dilation
2. lenght contraction
3. Gallian Transformations
4. Lorentz Transformations
5. Reletivitic doppler effect
6. Reletivitic Momentum
7. Reletivitic Energy
8. Reletivitic mass
9. lorentz factor (gamma)
10. speed ratio (beta)

for this calcuations we will use:

-the speed of light ,c which can be c= 3e8 m/s or c= 299792458 m/s
- velocity of the motion, v
-beta(speed ratio) = c / v
-gamma(lorentz factor) =
Time Dilation
