# Special-reletivity-calculator
This application is a calculator for all the effect and applcation of special reletivity 
this involes:
1. time dilation
2. lenght contraction
3. Gallian Transformations
4. Lorentz Transformations
5. Reletivitic doppler effect
6. Reletivitic Momentum
7. Reletivitic Kinetic Energy
8. Reletivitic Energy
9. lorentz factor (gamma)
10. speed ratio (beta)

for this calcuations we will use:

-the speed of light ,c which can be c= 3e8 m/s or c= 299792458 m/s



recomended ide is code:blocks
download code::blocks from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/20.03/Windows/32bit/codeblocks-20.03mingw-32bit-setup.exe

how to open project when using code::blocks
-git clone "https://github.com/paakofiaidoo/Special-reletivity-app.git"
-cd "Special Reletivity app"
-cd "Special Reletivity Calculator"
-"Special Reletivity Calculator.cbp" 

how to use when using other ide
git clone "https://github.com/paakofiaidoo/Special-reletivity-app.git"
cd "Special Reletivity app"
open folder in your text editor and play around from there
